## My process

I have been curious about how to use the Github API once I learned Asynchronous Javascript, so I took this challenge up to test myself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- API
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
 

### Useful resources
- [Github REST API with Vanilla Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlE6o-iYcE) was a wonderful resource as it helped me understand how to structure queries. It also provided great insight into Authentication and why a personal token is preferable over Basic Auth
